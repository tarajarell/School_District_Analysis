# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The school board is seeking a new, similar analysis after finding some of the data from a previous analysis on the math and reading scores was inaccurate. Seeking first to have the inaccurate data taken out of the analysis, the school board would like the analysis to be run again and to more accurately understand how the school districts and charters fared individually and overall. The school district would like the analysis to include the following: 

## Results
