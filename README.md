# School_District_Analysis

## Purpose
The school board is seeking a new, similar analysis after finding some of the data from a previous analysis on the math and reading scores was inaccurate. Seeking first to have the inaccurate data taken out of the analysis, the school board would like the analysis to be run again and to more accurately understand how the school districts and charters fared individually and overall. 

The school district would like the analysis to include the following: 

- A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
- An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
- Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
  - Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
  - The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
  - The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
  - School performance based on the budget per student
  - School performance based on the school size 
  - School performance based on the type of school
